Title: Jazz Harmony in the Post-Bebop Era: Modal Thinking, Extended Voicings, and the Art of Linear Voice-Leading

Abstract: In the decades following bebop, jazz harmony underwent a profound reorientation: from rapid chordal cycles and strictly functional progressions toward modal fields, expanded sonorities, and a renewed emphasis on linear voice-leading. This extended essay traces the historical trajectory of post-bop harmony, analyzes its core theoretical techniques—modal frameworks, upper-structure and quartal voicings, altered scales, and motivic linearization—and demonstrates how these techniques operate in canonical recordings by Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, and Wayne Shorter. The paper also discusses pedagogical implications for contemporary improvisers and composers, offering exercises and transcription-based methods to internalize post-bop practices. By integrating theory, transcription, and practical pedagogy, the essay provides a comprehensive resource for scholars and practitioners seeking to understand or teach the post-bop harmonic idiom.

Introduction

The bebop revolution of the 1940s and 1950s established a harmonic language characterized by rapid chord changes, sophisticated voice-leading, and virtuoso improvisational techniques that navigated dense harmonic terrain. In the late 1950s and through the 1960s, a new set of priorities emerged—modal exploration, sonic color, and motivic continuity—that shifted emphasis from vertical, chord-by-chord targeting to horizontal, linear development. This shift was not an abandonment of harmonic sophistication but a reframing: harmony became a canvas for coloristic exploration and motivic extension rather than merely a sequence of targets to be navigated.

This essay examines the theoretical underpinnings and practical techniques of post-bop harmony, organized into five sections: historical context and key figures; modal and scalar systems; extended voicings and sonority; linear voice-leading and motivic development; and pedagogical approaches. Each section combines analytical examples with practical exercises to help the reader internalize these practices.

1. Historical Context and Key Figures

1.1 The Modal Turn: Miles Davis, Bill Evans, and Kind of Blue

Miles Davis's Kind of Blue (1959) is often cited as a key inflection point. It popularized modal frameworks—pieces structured around scales or modes rather than frequent chord changes—allowing improvisers to dwell on scalar material and explore color and gesture. Bill Evans's harmonic sensibility, with its rich voicings and emphasis on inner voices, was central to this aesthetic. Modal tunes such as 'So What' exemplify how pared-back harmonic scaffolding fosters melodic invention and motivic development.

1.2 Coltrane's Synthesis: Changes, Sheets of Sound, and Beyond

John Coltrane synthesized complex harmonic motion with modal and scalar thinking. His 'Coltrane changes' reconfigure harmonic movement through tritone relationships and tonal planing, enabling rapid harmonic motion while retaining coherent voice-leading. Works like 'Giant Steps' demonstrate a dialectic between harmonic density and motivic continuity; later, Coltrane's modal explorations (e.g., 'My Favorite Things', 'A Love Supreme') emphasize sustained scalar fields and spiritualized linearity.

1.3 The Post-Bop Generation: Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and the Search for New Sonorities

Composers and performers in the post-bop era—Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, McCoy Tyner, Tony Williams—expanded harmonic color through modal ambiguity, non-functional progressions, and dense upper-structure voicings. Their work often includes shifting tonal centers, ambiguous cadences, and textural layering that encourage improvisers to think in terms of color and contour rather than strict functional resolution.

2. Modal and Scalar Systems: The Grammar of Post-Bop Scales

2.1 Modes as Harmonic Fields

Modal thinking treats modes (Dorian, Mixolydian, Lydian, etc.) as the structural basis for improvisation. Rather than interpreting chords as rapid targets, players treat a mode as a 'field'—a set of pitches and characteristic gestures available for melodic exploration. This approach enables motivic transposition, modal substitution, and the use of non-chord tones as coloristic devices rather than errors.

Practical exercise: Take a simple two-chord vamp (Dorian on D for eight bars, then Mixolydian on A for eight bars). Practice developing a three-note motive across the entire vamp, focusing on rhythmic variation and intervallic transformation rather than landing on chord tones every bar.

2.2 Synthetic and Altered Scales: Color and Tension

Post-bop harmonic language frequently employs altered and synthetic scales—altered scales (super Locrian), diminished, whole-tone, and Lydian augmented—particularly over dominant functions to create tension and color. These scales permit the strategic use of upper-structure extensions (b9, #9, #11, b13) and support the employment of upper-structure triads.

Transcription study: Analyze 'Nefertiti' (Miles Davis/Wayne Shorter) for uses of symmetric scales and non-diatonic alterations in melody and accompaniment.

3. Extended Harmony and Voicing Practices

3.1 Upper-Structure Triads and Quartal Harmony

Upper-structure triads are triads voiced above a bass note or foundational root that imply complex tensions. For instance, an E-major triad over a C7 bass implies extensions (E–G#–B) corresponding to #9 and #11 tensions depending on enharmonic interpretation. Quartal voicings stack fourths to produce a modern, open sonority favored by McCoy Tyner and others.

Practice approach: On piano or guitar, experiment with voicing a rootless voicing that uses an A major triad over a C7 bass (implying C7(#11, 13)). Sing the implied tensions to develop aural recognition.

3.2 Voice-Leading Through Extensions and Overtones

Post-bop voicings prioritize smooth inner-voice movement. Rather than voice-leading solely to triadic targets, players maintain common tones and move inner voices by step to preserve color continuity. This practice often employs extensions (9, 11, 13) as integral voice-leading pitches rather than peripheral ornaments.

Analytical example: Bill Evans's comping on 'Blue in Green' exhibits economies of motion: inner voices sustain non-chord tones that link successive harmonies, creating a floating, continuous texture.

4. Linear Voice-Leading and Motivic Development

4.1 Motivic Transformation Across Modal Fields

Linear thinking emphasizes the transformation and development of short motives as they traverse changing modal fields. A three- or four-note cell becomes the seed for an entire solo, varied rhythmically, intervallically, and ornamentally.

Exercise: Compose a four-note motive and practice transposing and developing it across a modal progression, recording each pass and annotating variations.

4.2 Voice-Leading and Tension-Release Without Functional Cadence

In the absence of conventional cadential motion, post-bop players use chromatic inner-voice motion, delayed resolutions, and motivic callbacks to create perceived direction and release. Such techniques satisfy listener expectations of narrative closure without reverting to tonic-dominant cycles.

5. Pedagogical Strategies and Compositional Applications

5.1 Transcription as Core Pedagogy

Transcribing solos and comping from post-bop masters remains the most direct path to internalizing the idiom. Transcriptions should be studied both vertically (harmonic choices) and horizontally (motivic development). Students should practice imitating phrasing and articulations before abstracting underlying theoretical principles.

5.2 Exercises for Developing Post-Bop Fluency

- Modal improvisation vamps: sustain modal vamps for extended practice, emphasizing motivic continuity.
- Inner-voice retention drills: practice keeping one or two inner voices steady while varying outer voices to feel the continuity of extensions.
- Upper-structure drills: map triads over common dominants and play them in multiple inversions to train ears for implied tensions.

5.3 Compositional Techniques for Post-Bop Writing

Composers can apply post-bop techniques by creating open forms (vamps, modal centers), specifying textural palettes (quartal voicings, pedal points), and using motivic fragments instead of long melodic lines. Writing with space in mind—leave room for improvisers to explore motivic intersections—enables the ensemble to realize the music's potential.

Conclusion

Post-bop harmony represents a sophisticated evolution of jazz language that privileges color, continuity, and motivic development over strict functional progression. Its techniques—modal fields, altered and synthetic scales, upper-structure voicings, and linear voice-leading—offer composers and improvisers a broad palette for expressive nuance. Pedagogically, the idiom rewards transcription, listening, and focused exercises that reinforce modal fluency and inner-voice awareness. As contemporary artists continue to synthesize past innovations with new harmonic ideas, the post-bop vocabulary remains a living, expanding resource for modern jazz practice.
