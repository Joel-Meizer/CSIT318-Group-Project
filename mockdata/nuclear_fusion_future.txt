Title: Nuclear Fusion at the Energy Transition: Physics, Engineering, Economics, and Governance

Abstract: Nuclear fusion offers a potentially transformative zero-carbon energy source with high energy density and abundant fuel supply. This synthesis reviews the scientific principles, major confinement approaches (magnetic and inertial), recent experimental milestones, and remaining materials and systems engineering challenges. Beyond technology, we analyze capital cost pathways, supply-chain constraints, waste and safety considerations, and governance needs for integrating fusion into decarbonization strategies. Drawing on ITER, NIF, private-sector advances in compact tokamaks and magnetized target fusion, and techno-economic studies, the paper provides an evidence-based assessment of fusion's realistic timelines and roles within diversified low-carbon portfolios. We conclude with policy recommendations to accelerate research while managing opportunity costs, prioritize demonstrable path-to-market metrics, and coordinate international governance for deployment and societal acceptance.

Introduction
The imperative to decarbonize global energy systems has brought renewed interest—and substantial investment—to controlled nuclear fusion. Unlike fission, fusion fuses light nuclei (e.g., deuterium and tritium) to release energy with minimal long-lived radioactive waste and negligible carbon emissions during operation. The physics underpinning fusion are well-understood, but implementing a practical, economically competitive fusion power plant requires overcoming formidable plasma-physics, materials, engineering, and systems-integration challenges. This review synthesizes the state of the art and frames fusion's possible trajectories in the context of energy-system decarbonization.

1. Fusion Physics and Confinement Approaches

1.1 Basic Reactions and Fuel Cycles
The most accessible reaction for near-term technology is D–T fusion (deuterium + tritium), which produces a 14.1 MeV neutron and a 3.5 MeV alpha particle. Deuterium is abundant in seawater; tritium must be bred in situ (typically from lithium blankets) or sourced externally. Longer-term options include D–He3 and p–B11, which reduce neutron production but require far higher temperatures and more challenging confinement.

1.2 Magnetic Confinement: Tokamaks, Stellarators, and Compact Devices
Magnetic confinement uses magnetic fields to confine hot plasma. Tokamaks (e.g., ITER) have achieved the most progress toward sustained burning plasmas. Stellarators (e.g., Wendelstein 7-X) offer steady-state operation without disruptive toroidal current, at the expense of complex coil geometries. Private-sector efforts focus on high-field, compact tokamaks enabled by high-temperature superconductors and novel coil designs, which aim to reduce capital costs and accelerate timelines.

1.3 Inertial and Alternative Confinement
Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) uses lasers or particle beams to compress fuel pellets rapidly; NIF's 2022 ignition milestone demonstrated proof-of-principle at high energy densities but faces scaling, repetition rate, and target fabrication challenges for power production. Magnetized target fusion and other hybrid approaches seek compromises between magnetic and inertial confinement to enable more practical engineering pathways.

2. Materials, Tritium Breeding, and Plasma–Wall Interactions

2.1 Plasma–Wall Challenges and Neutron Damage
High-energy neutrons from D–T reactions induce displacement damage, transmutation, and helium production in structural materials, leading to embrittlement and swelling. Developing low-activation, radiation-resistant alloys and designing replaceable first-wall modules are active research areas.

2.2 Tritium Breeding and Fuel Cycle Constraints
Commercial D–T fusion requires a tritium breeding ratio exceeding unity. Lithium-based breeding blankets must simultaneously thermalize neutrons and extract heat. The engineering of blankets, coolant choices (helium, molten salts, liquid metals), and tritium extraction/purification systems remain central challenges.

2.3 Materials Testing and Regulatory Implications
Material qualification demands accelerated neutron sources and testbeds to emulate fusion neutron spectra. Regulatory frameworks must account for novel activation products and lifecycle management of activated components.

3. Demonstrations, Private Innovation, and Timelines

3.1 ITER, DEMO, and Path-to-Grid Concepts
ITER aims to demonstrate sustained burning plasma and net fusion gain (Q>1) at experimental scale. Commercial demonstrations (often called DEMO) would follow to integrate blankets, tritium breeding, and power-extraction systems. Timelines are uncertain: ITER's operational schedule has faced delays; DEMO remains a mid-to-late-century prospect under conservative assumptions.

3.2 Private Sector Advances and Compact Concepts
Over the last decade, private firms have pursued compact high-field tokamaks, advanced magnet technology (REBCO superconductors), and alternative confinement schemes. These approaches prioritize reduced capital costs and modular manufacturing but face scaling and material qualification hurdles.

3.3 Techno-Economic Uncertainties
Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) projections for fusion vary widely due to capital-cost uncertainty, plant capacity factors, and learning rates. Economic competitiveness depends on modular manufacturing, high capacity factors, and integration with flexible grid services (e.g., heat for industrial processes).

4. Systems Integration, Safety, and Environmental Considerations

4.1 Operational Safety and Waste Profile
Fusion lacks the chain-reaction risk of fission and produces shorter-lived activation products if low-activation materials are used. Nonetheless, activated structural components and tritium handling raise safety, occupational exposure, and waste-disposition issues that require clear regulatory pathways.

4.2 Grid Integration and Role in Low-Carbon Mix
Fusion plants could provide steady baseload-like power and high-temperature heat for industrial decarbonization. Their economic value will depend on complementarity with renewables, storage, and demand-side flexibility—particularly if fusion capital costs remain high.

4.3 Supply Chains and Critical Materials
Scaling fusion deployment at pace requires domestic manufacturing of superconductors, low-activation alloys, and tritium-handling systems. Supply-chain vulnerabilities and competition with other high-tech sectors must be managed through industrial policy and international coordination.

5. Governance, Public Acceptance, and Policy Pathways

5.1 Research Funding, Risk-Sharing, and Public–Private Models
Given high upfront costs and long timelines, blended public–private funding models, milestone-based contracts, and guaranteed-offtake mechanisms can de-risk investments while preserving public oversight of safety and social returns.

5.2 International Cooperation and Nonproliferation
Fusion research is globally distributed; governance frameworks must address intellectual-property sharing, joint infrastructure, and nonproliferation guardrails (especially for potential fissile material production pathways in advanced cycles).

5.3 Societal Acceptance and Ethical Considerations
Framing fusion as part of a diversified decarbonization portfolio, along with transparent risk communication and community benefits agreements for host sites, will be crucial to build public legitimacy.

Conclusion
Fusion remains a high-potential but high-uncertainty option for long-term low-carbon energy. Scientific progress—including ignition demonstrations and high-field magnets—has reduced technical risk, but materials engineering, tritium breeding, and techno-economic viability remain substantial hurdles. Strategic policy that balances sustained public investment, targeted private incentives, and clear regulatory roadmaps will be necessary to translate scientific breakthroughs into practical power plants that complement renewables and contribute meaningfully to decarbonization.
