Title: The Influence of Sufism on the Poetry of Rumi

Abstract: This paper explores the profound influence of Sufism, the mystical dimension of Islam, on the poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi, one of the world's most beloved poets. We examine the key Sufi concepts that animate Rumi's work, such as the longing for union with the Divine, the annihilation of the self (fana), and the transformative power of love (ishq). Through a close reading of selected poems from his masterpieces, the Masnavi and the Divan-i Shams-i Tabrizi, we trace Rumi's spiritual journey and his poetic expression of the ineffable mystical experience. The paper argues that Rumi's poetry cannot be fully appreciated without an understanding of its deep roots in Sufi thought and practice.

Introduction
The poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi, with its ecstatic celebrations of love, its profound spiritual insights, and its universal appeal, has transcended its origins in 13th-century Persia to become a global phenomenon. However, to read Rumi merely as a poet of secular love is to miss the very essence of his work. This paper delves into the deep well of Sufi mysticism from which Rumi's poetry springs. We will begin by providing a brief overview of Sufism, its origins, and its core tenets. We will then explore the central theme of Rumi's poetry: the soul's yearning for reunion with its divine source. We will analyze how Rumi uses the language of romantic love, with its pain of separation and its ecstasy of union, as a metaphor for the relationship between the human soul and God. We will also examine the key Sufi concept of 'fana', the annihilation of the false self or ego, which is seen as a prerequisite for experiencing the divine presence. We will show how this idea is expressed in Rumi's poetry through images of drunkenness, madness, and the moth's self-immolation in the flame of the candle. Furthermore, we will discuss the pivotal role of Shams-i Tabrizi, Rumi's mysterious spiritual mentor, in his transformation from a sober scholar into a drunken poet of love. The encounter with Shams was a profound mystical experience for Rumi, and his poetry is a testament to the transformative power of this sacred friendship. By contextualizing Rumi's poetry within the framework of Sufi thought, this paper aims to provide a richer and more authentic understanding of his work, revealing it not just as beautiful literature, but as a guide to the spiritual path.

1.0 The Path of the Mystic: An Overview of Sufism

1.1 Core Tenets of Sufi Thought
Sufism, or 'tasawwuf' in Arabic, is the mystical dimension of Islam. It is not a separate sect of Islam, but rather a way of approaching the religion that emphasizes the inner life of the spirit and the direct experience of God. The central tenet of Sufism is 'tawhid', the oneness of God. For the Sufi, God is not a distant and remote creator, but an immanent presence that pervades all of creation. The goal of the Sufi is to achieve a state of union with the Divine, to lose oneself in the ocean of God's love. This journey of the soul towards God is known as the 'tariqa', or the path. The tariqa is a long and arduous one, and it requires the guidance of a spiritual master, or 'shaykh'. The shaykh is a friend of God, a 'wali', who has already traversed the path and can guide the disciple, or 'murid', on their journey. The Sufi path is a path of love, or 'ishq'. It is a passionate and all-consuming love for God that transcends all other loves. The Sufi is the lover, and God is the Beloved. The language of Sufi poetry is often the language of romantic love, with its longing, its pain of separation, and its ecstasy of union.

1.2 The Doctrine of Fana and Baqa
A key concept in Sufi thought is the doctrine of 'fana' and 'baqa'. Fana means 'annihilation' or 'passing away', and it refers to the annihilation of the false self, the ego, or the 'nafs'. The nafs is the part of the self that is attached to the world and to its own desires. It is the source of all sin and all suffering. The Sufi seeks to annihilate the nafs in order to achieve a state of 'baqa', which means 'subsistence' or 'remaining' in God. Fana is not a state of non-existence, but a state of true existence in God. It is the death of the ego and the birth of the true self, the self that is one with God. The doctrine of fana and baqa is a difficult and paradoxical one, and it is often expressed in the language of metaphor and symbol. The image of the moth that is consumed by the flame of the candle is a common metaphor for fana. The moth is so drawn to the light of the candle that it flies into the flame and is consumed by it. In the same way, the Sufi is so drawn to the light of God that they are consumed by it, and they lose their separate identity in the oneness of the Divine.

2.0 The Transformative Encounter: Rumi and Shams-i Tabrizi

2.1 The Meeting of Two Oceans
The course of Rumi's life was forever changed by his encounter with the wandering dervish, Shams-i Tabrizi, in the city of Konya in 1244. At the time, Rumi was a respected religious scholar, a sober and serious man who was deeply learned in the Islamic sciences. Shams was a mysterious and enigmatic figure, a man who was said to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. The meeting of these two men was like the meeting of two oceans. Shams initiated Rumi into the mysteries of Sufism, and he taught him the path of divine love. The two men spent months together in intense spiritual conversation, and Rumi was transformed by the experience. He abandoned his life as a scholar and became a poet, a musician, and a dancer. He founded the Mevlevi order of Sufis, who are also known as the 'whirling dervishes' because of their ecstatic dance of remembrance, or 'sema'.

2.2 The Disappearance of the Beloved
The relationship between Rumi and Shams was a source of great scandal and controversy in Konya. Rumi's disciples were jealous of the influence that Shams had over their master, and they eventually drove Shams out of the city. Rumi was heartbroken by the departure of his beloved friend, and he wrote a series of passionate and grief-stricken poems in which he longed for the return of Shams. Shams did eventually return to Konya, but he disappeared again a few years later, this time for good. It is not known what happened to Shams, but it is widely believed that he was murdered by a group of Rumi's disciples. The disappearance of Shams was a devastating blow to Rumi, but it was also the catalyst for his greatest poetic achievement. In his grief, Rumi began to write the 'Divan-i Shams-i Tabrizi', a vast collection of odes and quatrains in which he poured out his love for his lost friend. In these poems, Rumi identifies himself with Shams, and he speaks with the voice of the Beloved. The 'Divan' is a testament to the transformative power of love, and it is one of the greatest works of mystical poetry ever written.

3.0 The Masnavi: A Spiritual Epic

3.1 Themes of the Masnavi
The 'Masnavi' is Rumi's magnum opus, a vast and sprawling epic poem that is often called the 'Qur'an in the Persian language'. The 'Masnavi' is a collection of stories, fables, and parables that are designed to illustrate the teachings of Sufism. The stories are drawn from a wide variety of sources, from the Qur'an and the Hadith to the folk tales of Persia and India. The 'Masnavi' is a book of wisdom, a guide to the spiritual path. It is a book that is meant to be read and re-read, a book that reveals its secrets slowly and over time. The central theme of the 'Masnavi' is the love of God. Rumi uses the stories in the 'Masnavi' to illustrate the different stages of the spiritual path, from the initial awakening of the soul to the final state of union with the Divine. The 'Masnavi' is a book that is full of hope and encouragement, a book that reminds us that the path to God is open to all who seek it.

3.2 The Didactic and the Narrative in the Masnavi
The 'Masnavi' is a didactic work, but it is not a dry and academic treatise. Rumi is a master storyteller, and he uses the power of narrative to engage the reader and to draw them into the world of the spirit. The stories in the 'Masnavi' are full of humor, pathos, and psychological insight. They are stories that speak to the heart as well as to the mind. Rumi is also a master of the poetic art, and the 'Masnavi' is a work of great literary beauty. The language of the 'Masnavi' is simple and direct, but it is also capable of expressing the most profound and complex spiritual truths. The 'Masnavi' is a book that can be read on many different levels. It can be read as a collection of entertaining stories, as a guide to the spiritual path, or as a work of great literary art. It is a book that has something to offer to everyone, regardless of their religious or cultural background.

4.0 The Divan-i Shams-i Tabrizi: The Ecstasy of Divine Love

4.1 Themes of the Divan
The 'Divan-i Shams-i Tabrizi' is a collection of poems that Rumi wrote in the years following the disappearance of his beloved friend and mentor, Shams-i Tabrizi. The 'Divan' is a work of great passion and intensity, a testament to the transformative power of love. The central theme of the 'Divan' is the longing for the Beloved. Rumi uses the language of romantic love to express his yearning for union with the Divine. The poems in the 'Divan' are full of images of wine, drunkenness, and madness. These are not to be taken literally, but as metaphors for the ecstatic state of the soul that is intoxicated with the love of God. The 'Divan' is a book that celebrates the beauty and the power of love, a book that reminds us that love is the most powerful force in the universe.

4.2 The Poetics of Ecstasy
The poems in the 'Divan' are written in a variety of forms, from the ghazal, or love ode, to the ruba'i, or quatrain. The language of the 'Divan' is highly musical and rhythmic, and it is designed to be sung or chanted. The poems are full of repetition and refrain, and they have a hypnotic and incantatory quality. The 'Divan' is a book that is meant to be experienced, not just read. It is a book that is designed to transport the reader to a state of spiritual ecstasy. The poems in the 'Divan' are a powerful expression of the Sufi belief that music and dance can be a means of achieving a state of union with the Divine.

Conclusion
The poetry of Rumi is a testament to the transformative power of Sufism. Rumi was a man who was transformed by his encounter with the mystical dimension of Islam, and his poetry is a powerful expression of his spiritual journey. Rumi's poetry is a gift to the world, a reminder that the path to God is a path of love, and that the language of the heart is a universal one. His work continues to inspire and to console millions of people around the world, and it is a powerful testament to the enduring power of the human spirit.
