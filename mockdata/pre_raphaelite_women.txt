Title: The Representation of Women in Pre-Raphaelite Painting

Abstract: This paper examines the complex and often contradictory representation of women in the art of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. We analyze the ways in which Pre-Raphaelite painters such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais, and William Holman Hunt challenged the idealized and sentimentalized depictions of women that were prevalent in Victorian art. We explore their fascination with literary and historical heroines, their use of a new, more naturalistic style, and their creation of a distinctive and enduring female type. The paper argues that while the Pre-Raphaelites offered a more complex and sensual vision of womanhood, their work often remained trapped within the patriarchal ideologies of their time, oscillating between the archetypes of the 'femme fatale' and the 'damsel in distress'.

Introduction
The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, founded in 1848, was a group of young and rebellious artists who sought to revitalize British art by rejecting the academic conventions of their day and returning to the detailed observation and vibrant colors of early Italian painting. This paper focuses on one of the most striking and controversial aspects of their work: their representation of women. We will begin by examining the Pre-Raphaelites' rejection of the idealized and often insipid female figures of mainstream Victorian art. In their place, they painted women who were more realistic, more sensual, and more psychologically complex. We will analyze their use of specific models, such as Elizabeth Siddal and Jane Morris, whose unconventional beauty and striking red hair became hallmarks of the Pre-Raphaelite style. We will then explore the Pre-Raphaelites' fascination with literary and historical subjects, and their depiction of powerful and often tragic female characters from the works of Shakespeare, Dante, and Keats. We will analyze iconic paintings such as Millais's 'Ophelia' and Rossetti's 'Proserpine', and discuss how the Pre-Raphaelites used these figures to explore themes of love, death, and female sexuality. However, we will also argue that the Pre-Raphaelite vision of womanhood was far from progressive. We will show how their work is often structured around a binary opposition between the spiritual and the sensual, the virtuous and the fallen woman. We will analyze the recurring archetype of the 'femme fatale', the beautiful and dangerous temptress who lures men to their doom, as seen in paintings such as Burne-Jones's 'The Beguiling of Merlin'. We will also discuss the prevalence of the 'damsel in distress', the passive and suffering victim of male desire or cruelty. By examining the complex interplay of realism and romanticism, of liberation and limitation, in Pre-Raphaelite painting, this paper aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the ways in which these Vi...

1.0 The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the Rejection of Academic Art

1.1 The Victorian Ideal of Womanhood
The Victorian era was a period of great social and economic change, but it was also a time of rigid social conventions and strict moral codes. The ideal of Victorian womanhood was the 'angel in the house', a domestic creature who was pure, pious, and submissive to her husband. This ideal was reflected in the art of the period, which was dominated by sentimental and moralizing scenes of domestic life. Women were depicted as dutiful wives, loving mothers, and innocent daughters, their lives confined to the private sphere of the home. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood rejected this idealized and sentimentalized vision of womanhood. They were drawn to women who were more complex, more passionate, and more independent. They were fascinated by the stories of powerful and often tragic heroines from literature and history, and they sought to create a new and more realistic vision of womanhood in their art.

1.2 The Pre-Raphaelite Aesthetic
The Pre-Raphaelites were a group of young and rebellious artists who were determined to break with the academic conventions of their day. They rejected the dark and gloomy palette of the Royal Academy, and they embraced a new and more vibrant style of painting that was inspired by the art of the early Italian Renaissance. The Pre-Raphaelites were committed to the idea of 'truth to nature', and they painted with a meticulous attention to detail that was unprecedented in British art. They were also deeply interested in the relationship between art and literature, and they often chose subjects from the works of Shakespeare, Dante, and Keats. The Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic was a complex and often contradictory one. It was a mixture of realism and romanticism, of naturalism and symbolism, of the sacred and the profane. This complexity is nowhere more evident than in their representation of women.

2.0 The Pre-Raphaelite Woman: A New Type of Beauty

2.1 Elizabeth Siddal: The Tragic Muse
Elizabeth Siddal was the most famous of the Pre-Raphaelite models, and she was the muse and the obsession of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Siddal was a young and beautiful woman with a striking and unconventional appearance. She had long, flowing red hair, a pale complexion, and a languid and melancholic expression. She was the embodiment of the Pre-Raphaelite ideal of beauty, and she was the model for some of the most iconic paintings of the movement, including Millais's 'Ophelia' and Rossetti's 'Beata Beatrix'. Siddal was also a talented artist and poet in her own right, but her life was a tragic one. She suffered from ill health for most of her life, and she died of an overdose of laudanum at the age of 32. Her tragic story has become a powerful symbol of the Pre-Raphaelite fascination with love, death, and the figure of the suffering woman.

2.2 Jane Morris: The Queenly Stunner
Jane Morris was another of the great Pre-Raphaelite muses. She was the wife of the artist and designer William Morris, and she was the lover of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Jane Morris was a woman of great beauty and intelligence, and she was a powerful and a charismatic presence. She was the model for some of Rossetti's most famous paintings, including 'Proserpine' and 'Astarte Syriaca'. In these paintings, she is depicted as a queenly and a mysterious figure, a woman of great power and of great sadness. Jane Morris was a more earthy and a more sensual figure than Elizabeth Siddal, and she represents a different aspect of the Pre-Raphaelite ideal of womanhood. She is the 'femme fatale', the beautiful and dangerous temptress who lures men to their doom.

3.0 Literary and Historical Heroines

3.1 Shakespeare's Women: Ophelia and Mariana
The Pre-Raphaelites were great admirers of Shakespeare, and they were particularly drawn to his tragic heroines. John Everett Millais's painting of 'Ophelia' is one of the most famous and beloved paintings of the 19th century. The painting depicts the drowning of Ophelia from Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. Ophelia is shown floating in a stream, her hair spread out around her and her hands clutching a garland of flowers. The painting is a masterpiece of naturalistic detail, and it is a powerful and a moving depiction of a young woman's descent into madness and despair. Millais's painting of 'Mariana' is another powerful depiction of a suffering woman from Shakespeare. The painting is based on a character from Shakespeare's 'Measure for Measure', and it depicts a young woman who has been abandoned by her lover. Mariana is shown in a dark and gloomy room, her back arched in a gesture of despair. The painting is a powerful and a moving depiction of the pain of unrequited love.

3.2 Dante's Beatrice and the Cult of Courtly Love
Dante Gabriel Rossetti was obsessed with the work of the great Italian poet Dante Alighieri, and he was particularly drawn to the figure of Beatrice, Dante's idealized beloved. Rossetti painted Beatrice many times, and she became for him a symbol of spiritual and artistic inspiration. Rossetti's paintings of Beatrice are a powerful expression of the cult of courtly love, the medieval tradition of chivalrous and idealized love. In these paintings, Beatrice is depicted as a remote and an unattainable figure, a woman who is more of a spiritual guide than a flesh-and-blood woman. Rossetti's paintings of Beatrice are a powerful and a moving expression of the Pre-Raphaelite fascination with the spiritual and the ideal.

4.0 The Femme Fatale and the Damsel in Distress

4.1 The Beguiling of Merlin and the Fear of Female Sexuality
The Pre-Raphaelites were fascinated by the figure of the 'femme fatale', the beautiful and dangerous temptress who lures men to their doom. Edward Burne-Jones's painting 'The Beguiling of Merlin' is a powerful example of this archetype. The painting depicts the moment when the enchantress Nimue seduces the magician Merlin and steals his powers. Nimue is shown as a beautiful and a seductive figure, but she is also a figure of great power and of great danger. The painting is a powerful expression of the Victorian fear of female sexuality, of the idea that women are a dangerous and a destructive force that must be controlled.

4.2 The Scapegoat and the Fallen Woman
The Pre-Raphaelites were also fascinated by the figure of the 'fallen woman', the woman who has been cast out of society because of her sexual transgressions. William Holman Hunt's painting 'The Awakening Conscience' is a powerful depiction of a fallen woman. The painting depicts a young woman who is sitting on the lap of her lover. She has a look of sudden realization on her face, as if she has just become aware of the sinfulness of her situation. The painting is a powerful and a moving depiction of the Victorian obsession with sexual purity, and of the terrible consequences for women who transgressed the strict moral codes of the time.

Conclusion
The Pre-Raphaelite representation of women was a complex and a contradictory one. The Pre-Raphaelites rejected the idealized and sentimentalized vision of womanhood that was prevalent in Victorian art, and they created a new and more realistic and sensual vision of womanhood in their art. However, their work often remained trapped within the patriarchal ideologies of their time. They were fascinated by the figure of the powerful and independent woman, but they were also deeply afraid of female sexuality. Their work oscillates between the archetypes of the 'femme fatale' and the 'damsel in distress', and it is a powerful and a moving expression of the anxieties and the contradictions of the Victorian age.
