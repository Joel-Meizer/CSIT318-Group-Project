Title: Mycorrhizal Networks and Forest Resilience: Function, Connectivity, and Climate Response in Temperate Woodlands

Abstract: Mycorrhizal fungi form complex and dynamic networks that underpin nutrient cycling, plant health, and community-level resilience in temperate forests. This paper synthesizes contemporary mechanistic studies, landscape-scale surveys, and manipulation experiments to assess how fungal functional diversity, network architecture, and plant–fungus carbon–nutrient exchanges influence forest responses to disturbance and climate variability. We examine differences between ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) systems, explore empirical and theoretical models of network topology and resource flow, and evaluate evidence for mycorrhizal mediation of regeneration, drought tolerance, and pathogen resistance. The review culminates in management recommendations to integrate fungal connectivity into restoration and silviculture, and outlines priority research directions to close critical knowledge gaps. By reframing belowground networks as active drivers of forest resilience, the paper argues for explicit consideration of mycorrhizal dynamics in conservation and adaptive management plans.

Introduction
Temperate woodlands are sustained by intricate belowground partnerships between plants and a diverse mycobiome. Mycorrhizal fungi—both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) taxa—extend the effective absorptive surface of plant roots, mobilize nutrients, and form mycelial connections that interlink individuals and species into spatially structured networks. Termed the "wood-wide web," these fungal networks redistribute carbon and nutrients, modulate plant stress responses, and influence community assembly and succession. As climate change and anthropogenic land-use pressures intensify, understanding the role of mycorrhizae in supporting forest resistance and recovery becomes essential for effective stewardship.

This paper synthesizes empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks addressing five core topics: (1) functional diversity and physiology of mycorrhizal guilds; (2) network architecture and mechanisms of resource sharing; (3) roles in succession, regeneration, and community dynamics; (4) responses to environmental stressors including drought, warming, pollution, and biological invasions; and (5) management implications and restoration strategies. Across sections we emphasize mechanistic linkages, scalable patterns, and actionable research priorities.

1. Functional Diversity and Physiology

1.1 EM and AM Functional Contrasts
Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) differ profoundly in morphology, enzymatic capabilities, and ecological roles. EM fungi typically form dense sheaths (mantles) and extensive extraradical mycelia around the roots of many temperate trees (e.g., Fagaceae, Pinaceae), access organic nutrient pools via exoenzymes, and often display high host specificity. AM fungi, ubiquitous across herbaceous plants and many woody species, penetrate root cortical cells to form arbuscules and primarily facilitate uptake of inorganic phosphorus and other mineral nutrients. These functional contrasts drive divergent influences on nutrient cycling: EM-dominated systems often exhibit slower litter decomposition and stronger organic nutrient retention, while AM systems can favor faster nutrient turnover and different plant community dynamics.

1.2 Carbon–Nutrient Exchange and Mutualism Dynamics
Mycorrhizal relationships are mediated by flow of photosynthetically fixed carbon from plants to fungi and reciprocal transfer of nutrients. Allocation is context-dependent: under low nutrient availability, hosts invest more carbon into fungal partners with higher nutrient returns; conversely, abundant soil nutrients can diminish mutualism strength. Quantitative models combining plant C budgeting and fungal nutrient foraging predict tipping points where symbioses shift along a mutualism–parasitism continuum. Isotopic tracer studies (e.g., 13C, 15N) have documented bidirectional transfers among trees mediated by shared mycelium, revealing that resource exchange is influenced by source–sink gradients, phenology, and partner identity.

1.3 Physiological Plasticity and Thermal Sensitivity
Fungal physiology, including respiration rates, enzyme activity, and hyphal growth, responds to temperature and moisture. Some EM species display thermal resilience and enzymatic versatility, enabling access to complex organic N at lower temperatures; AM fungi may be more sensitive to soil moisture deficits but quicker to re-establish after disturbance. Understanding species-level physiological traits is key to predicting how shifts in fungal composition will alter nutrient fluxes under climate change.

2. Network Architecture and Resource Sharing

2.1 Topology: Hubs, Modularity, and Connectivity
Network analyses reveal that mycorrhizal associations are non-random: fungal taxa vary in degree (number of host partners), centrality (importance as connectors), and modularity (subgroups of tightly interacting species). Highly connected 'hub' fungi can integrate across plant species and spatial patches, facilitating indirect interactions and emergent community properties. Modularity can stabilize systems by localizing perturbations, while high centralization around a few hubs can increase vulnerability to hub loss. Spatially explicit sampling and molecular metabarcoding have been instrumental in mapping these architectures across forest stands.

2.2 Mechanisms of Transfer: From Hyphae to Landscape Fluxes
Hyphal networks enable movement of water, carbon, and nutrients across centimeter to meter scales. Experiments using labeled isotopes show directional flow from photosynthetically active donors (e.g., canopy trees) to shaded seedlings or nutrient-poor individuals, mediated by fungal partners. However, transfer is often asymmetric and regulated by fungal physiology and ecological context: nutrient-rich sinks may receive more than neutral sinks, and fungal partner identity modulates transfer rates. Scaling these processes to landscape nutrient budgets remains a challenge but is critical for linking belowground networks to ecosystem-level resilience.

2.3 Temporal Dynamics and Phenology
Network structure and transfer dynamics vary seasonally. During leaf-out and periods of high photosynthesis, carbon flows to mycorrhizae surge, increasing fungal biomass and hyphal connectivity. Conversely, in dormancy or drought, reduced carbon supply contracts network activity. This temporal variability influences seedling establishment windows, pathogen outbreaks, and recovery trajectories following disturbance.

3. Succession, Regeneration, and Community Dynamics

3.1 Mycorrhizae and Seedling Recruitment
Mycorrhizal inoculation frequently enhances seedling establishment, particularly in shaded understories or degraded soils. Nursery inoculation and soil transplants can improve survival and growth of target species during restoration. Importantly, compatibility between seedling hosts and local fungal communities determines restoration success: introducing seedlings without compatible fungal partners often results in poor establishment.

3.2 Facilitation, Competition, and Coexistence
Mycorrhizal networks mediate facilitative and competitive interactions. Resource transfer can buffer conspecific seedlings against stress, promoting coexistence, but networks can also reinforce dominance by enabling competitive trees to gain disproportionate resources. Fungal specificity plays a central role: generalist fungi promote interspecific connectivity and potential facilitation, while specialist fungi can enforce host-specific competitive hierarchies.

3.3 Community Assembly and Feedbacks
Plant–fungus feedbacks influence successional trajectories. For example, early successional plants may foster fungal communities that favor rapid nutrient cycling, while late-successional trees promote EM assemblages that stabilize organic nutrient pools. These feedbacks generate alternative stable states with implications for management and restoration.

4. Responses to Environmental Stressors

4.1 Drought, Warming, and Extreme Events
Climate-driven droughts and heatwaves alter mycorrhizal community composition and reduce network connectivity. Drought can reduce host carbon allocation to fungi, leading to hyphal dieback and decreased seedling protection. Some fungal taxa confer drought tolerance by improving host water relations and osmotic adjustments, but the distribution of such tolerant taxa is uneven across landscapes.

4.2 Nitrogen Deposition, Soil Disturbance, and Pollution
Increased nitrogen deposition tends to simplify fungal communities, favoring nitrophilous species and reducing diversity. Soil compaction, tilling, and other disturbances break hyphal networks and reduce inoculum potential, undermining regeneration and increasing erosion risk. Heavy metals and pollutants can directly impair fungal enzyme function, reducing nutrient mobilization.

4.3 Biological Invasions and Pathogens
Invasive plants can disrupt native mycorrhizal networks by altering soil chemistry or by forming preferential associations with generalist fungi, thereby changing native plant competitive dynamics. Conversely, mycorrhizae can sometimes protect hosts against soil-borne pathogens through competitive exclusion or induction of host defenses; however, pathogen outbreaks may also be exacerbated if networks facilitate the spread of disease agents.

5. Management Implications and Restoration Strategies

5.1 Incorporating Mycorrhizae into Silviculture and Restoration
Management that explicitly accounts for fungal connectivity can enhance resilience. Practical measures include conserving legacy trees that maintain inoculum reservoirs, minimizing soil disturbance during logging, employing site-appropriate mycorrhizal inocula in nurseries, and using nurse plants to establish fungal networks. In afforestation and assisted migration projects, matching plant material with compatible fungal communities increases establishment success under novel climates.

5.2 Monitoring, Indicators, and Decision Support
Practical monitoring should combine molecular assays (metabarcoding) with functional indicators (enzyme activities, hyphal length, soil respiration) to assess network integrity. Developing early-warning indicators—such as declines in hub taxa or reductions in network connectivity—can guide adaptive interventions.

5.3 Policy and Land-Use Integration
Incorporating mycorrhizal considerations into forest policy may involve guidelines for soil protection, incentives for retaining legacy trees, and standards for nursery practices. Recognizing fungal contributions to carbon sequestration and soil health could inform payments for ecosystem services and reforestation financing.

Conclusion
Mycorrhizal networks are central to temperate forest function and resilience. They mediate nutrient cycling, influence regeneration and species composition, and modulate responses to biotic and abiotic stressors. Management strategies that preserve and restore fungal connectivity—through minimized soil disturbance, targeted inoculation, and retention of biological legacies—can enhance forest resistance and recovery under a changing climate. To operationalize these strategies, research should prioritize trait-based approaches linking fungal identity to ecosystem functions, develop scalable monitoring tools, and quantify how belowground network changes translate into landscape-level outcomes.
