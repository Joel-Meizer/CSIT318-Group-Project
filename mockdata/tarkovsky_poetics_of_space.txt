Title: The Poetics of Space in the Films of Andrei Tarkovsky

Abstract: This paper analyzes the unique and highly personal use of space in the films of the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. We explore how Tarkovsky transcends a purely narrative or decorative conception of space, transforming it into a powerful medium for the expression of spiritual and metaphysical themes. Through a close analysis of key scenes from films such as Stalker, Solaris, and The Mirror, we examine Tarkovsky's use of long takes, slow camera movements, and richly textured natural and architectural environments. The paper argues that for Tarkovsky, space is not merely a backdrop for human action, but a living, breathing presence, a landscape of the soul.

Introduction
The films of Andrei Tarkovsky are renowned for their haunting beauty, their philosophical depth, and their profound spiritual power. This paper focuses on a crucial but often overlooked aspect of his cinematic art: his masterful and highly original use of space. We will argue that Tarkovsky's films are not so much stories that happen in a place, but places that tell a story. We will begin by examining Tarkovsky's relationship with the natural world. We will analyze his use of the four elements – earth, water, fire, and air – and his recurring motifs of rain, mist, and flowing water. We will show how Tarkovsky imbues these natural phenomena with a powerful symbolic and spiritual resonance, suggesting a world that is alive with a hidden meaning. We will then turn to Tarkovsky's treatment of architectural space. We will explore his fascination with dilapidated and abandoned buildings, which he transforms into spaces of memory, nostalgia, and spiritual longing. We will analyze the iconic image of the dacha, the Russian country house, which in films like The Mirror and Nostalghia becomes a powerful symbol of home, childhood, and lost innocence. Furthermore, we will discuss Tarkovsky's distinctive use of cinematic time, particularly his famous long takes and slow, meditative camera movements. We will argue that these techniques create a sense of 'sculpting in time', allowing the viewer to inhabit the space of the film and to experience its subtle shifts in mood and atmosphere. By drawing on the writings of the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, particularly his concept of the 'poetics of space', this paper will demonstrate how Tarkovsky's cinema offers a profound and moving exploration of the ways in which we experience and imagine the spaces we inhabit. For Tarkovsky, the ultimate landscape is the human soul, and his films are a journey into its mysterious and uncharted territory.

1.0 The Natural World: A Landscape of the Soul

1.1 The Four Elements: Earth, Water, Fire, and Air
Tarkovsky's films are saturated with the presence of the four classical elements. Earth, in Tarkovsky's cinema, is a symbol of rootedness, of belonging, of the deep connection between human beings and the land. It is the soil from which we come and to which we will return. Water is perhaps the most pervasive and multivalent of Tarkovsky's elemental symbols. It is a symbol of life, of purification, of memory, and of the unconscious. The recurring motif of rain in Tarkovsky's films is not simply a meteorological phenomenon, but a spiritual one. It is a sign of grace, of a world that is being washed clean. Fire is a more ambivalent symbol. It is a symbol of destruction, but also of purification and of spiritual passion. The burning of the dacha at the end of 'The Mirror' is a powerful and unforgettable image of the destruction of a world, but it is also a moment of sublime and terrible beauty. Air, in Tarkovsky's films, is often associated with the spiritual and the transcendent. It is the element of wind and of breath, of the invisible forces that move through the world and through our lives.

1.2 The Dacha: A Space of Memory and Longing
The dacha, the Russian country house, is a recurring and iconic image in Tarkovsky's films. It is a symbol of home, of childhood, of a lost world of innocence and grace. In 'The Mirror', the dacha is the central space of the film, the place where the narrator's memories of his childhood are located. The dacha is a place of great beauty, but it is also a place of great sadness. It is a place that is haunted by the past, by the memory of a world that has been lost forever. In 'Nostalghia', the dacha is a more distant and idealized image. It is the object of the protagonist's longing, a symbol of the home that he has left behind and to which he can never return. The dacha, for Tarkovsky, is a powerful symbol of the human condition, of our longing for a home that we can never truly possess.

2.0 The Architectural Space: Ruins and Thresholds

2.1 The Ruin as a Site of Memory
Tarkovsky had a deep fascination with ruins, with dilapidated and abandoned buildings that have been reclaimed by nature. For Tarkovsky, the ruin is not a symbol of decay and death, but a site of memory and of spiritual renewal. The ruin is a place where the past and the present coexist, where the boundaries between time and space are dissolved. In 'Stalker', the Zone is a vast and mysterious landscape of ruins, a place where the normal laws of physics no longer apply. The Zone is a place of great danger, but it is also a place of great beauty and of profound spiritual power. It is a place where the three protagonists are forced to confront their deepest fears and desires, and where they are given the opportunity to find a new and more authentic way of being in the world.

2.2 The Threshold as a Place of Transition
The threshold is another recurring motif in Tarkovsky's films. The threshold is a place of transition, a place where one world ends and another begins. It is a place of great spiritual significance, a place where the sacred and the profane, the human and the divine, meet. In 'Solaris', the space station is a threshold between the world of the earth and the world of the mysterious and sentient ocean of Solaris. The space station is a place of great psychological and spiritual intensity, a place where the protagonist is forced to confront the ghost of his dead wife and to come to terms with his own past. The threshold, for Tarkovsky, is a place of crisis and of opportunity, a place where we are given the chance to be transformed.

3.0 The Cinematic Space: Sculpting in Time

3.1 The Long Take and the Meditative Gaze
Tarkovsky is famous for his use of the long take, the extended and uninterrupted shot that allows the viewer to inhabit the space of the film and to experience its subtle shifts in mood and atmosphere. The long take is a form of cinematic meditation, a way of slowing down our perception of time and of allowing us to see the world in a new and more profound way. Tarkovsky's camera is a patient and a contemplative one. It is a camera that is content to simply watch, to observe, to bear witness. The long take is a way of respecting the integrity of space and of time, of allowing the world to reveal itself in its own way and in its own time.

3.2 The Slow Camera Movement and the Revelation of Space
Tarkovsky's camera is not a static one. It is a camera that is constantly in motion, but its movements are slow, deliberate, and almost imperceptible. The slow camera movement is a way of revealing space, of gradually unfolding it before our eyes. It is a way of creating a sense of mystery and of anticipation, of drawing us deeper into the world of the film. The slow camera movement is also a way of creating a sense of spiritual presence, of a world that is alive with a hidden meaning. Tarkovsky's camera is a spiritual instrument, a tool for the exploration of the invisible world that lies beyond the surface of reality.

4.0 Bachelard and the Poetics of Space

4.1 The House as a Universe
The French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, in his book 'The Poetics of Space', argues that the house is our first universe, the place where we learn to dream and to imagine. The house is a space of intimacy and of memory, a place where our deepest and most cherished experiences are located. Bachelard's ideas have a deep resonance with Tarkovsky's films. The dacha, in Tarkovsky's cinema, is a powerful example of the house as a universe. It is a space that is saturated with memory and with longing, a place that is both a physical and a spiritual home.

4.2 The Dialectics of Inside and Outside
Bachelard also explores the dialectics of inside and outside, of the ways in which we experience the world as a series of enclosed and open spaces. The house, for Bachelard, is a space of enclosure and of protection, a place where we can retreat from the vast and often threatening world outside. Tarkovsky's films are full of images of enclosure and of escape, of characters who are trapped in confined spaces and who long for the freedom of the open world. The Zone, in 'Stalker', is a vast and open space, but it is also a place of great danger and of profound spiritual challenge. The dialectics of inside and outside, in Tarkovsky's films, is a powerful metaphor for the human condition, for our struggle to find a place of safety and of belonging in a world that is often hostile and indifferent.

Conclusion
The films of Andrei Tarkovsky are a profound and a moving exploration of the poetics of space. For Tarkovsky, space is not simply a container for human action, but a living and a breathing presence, a landscape of the soul. His films are a journey into the mysterious and uncharted territory of the human heart, a search for a home that is both a physical and a spiritual one. Tarkovsky's cinema is a cinema of great beauty and of great spiritual power, a cinema that will continue to haunt and to inspire us for many years to come.
